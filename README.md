# Casino
Originally a project to learn Object-oriented principles.  Slowly morphing into learning Agile processes and guidelines.  

# Basic Principles
Uses object-oriented principles to create multiple classes to mimic a casino craps game.  
*  Combines classes with methods and procedural programming 

# Basic Usage
Copy casino folder to computer, run the craps.py script to see basic example.  The current automation is to have all players bet a random sum of money on hard 12.

The goal is to simulate a craps table, have the random players automatically place and collect bets, and create a database of table information to perform data analysis.
