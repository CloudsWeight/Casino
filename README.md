# Casino
Originally a project to learn Object-oriented principles.  Slowly morphing into learning Agile processes and guidelines.  

# Basic Principles
Uses object-oriented principles to create multiple classes to mimic a casino craps game.  
*  Combines classes with methods and procedural programming 

# Basic Idea
Copy casino folder to computer, run the casino.py script to see basic example.

The ultimate goal is to simlate a craps table and have the random players automatically place bets and roll the dice. 
In the process of creating complex statistics from player rolls. 

# Doc.txt
Plaeholder for notes/plans for the project.
